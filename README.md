- `project.py`: The main logic and code of application
- `test_project.py` : It contains 'pytest' unit tests for core functions like password generator etc.

# Why this project ?
I chose this project because I wanted to do something practical .

I used regex , user input and improved my command-line interface skills.
I wrote the logic in way that the input is valid and making sure the user experience was smooth .

ðŸš€ How to Run
Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

In terminal:
python project.py : For main logic and code of project
pytest test_project.py : For pytest unit.

## ðŸŽ‡Final Thoughts :
This project helped me to apply all the skills I learned in CS50P.
This was my first project . CS50P gave me confidence to build more practical projects like this.

Thank you CS50P!
